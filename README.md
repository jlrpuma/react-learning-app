# react-learning-app

I just create this application with learning purposes in mind, so don't be shy to do some comments that can help me to improve my skills on this topic.

1) Create a simple Todo App
This will be a very simple implementation of a Todo app that is going to be evolving, adding more concepts related to advanced topics of React but its pretty simple so far...
